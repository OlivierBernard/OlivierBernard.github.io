Machine learning (ML) has been increasingly used within cardiology, particularly in the domain of cardiovascular imaging. Due to the inherent complexity and flexibility of ML algorithms, inconsistencies in the model performance and interpretation may occur. Several review articles have been recently published that introduce the fundamental principles and clinical application of ML for general cardiologists. The current document builds on these introductory principles and outlines a more comprehensive list of crucial responsibilities that need to be completed when developing ML models. The document thus aims to serve as a scientific foundation to aid investigators, data scientists, authors, editors, and reviewers involved in machine learning research with the intent of uniform reporting of ML investigations. An independent multidisciplinary panel of ML experts, clinicians, and statisticians worked together to review the theoretical rationale underlying seven sets of requirements that may reduce algorithmic errors and biases. Finally, the document summarizes a list of reporting items as an itemized checklist
that highlight steps for ensuring correct application of ML models and the consistent reporting of model specifications and results. It is expected that the rapid pace of research and development and the increased availability of real-world evidence may require periodic updates to the checklist
