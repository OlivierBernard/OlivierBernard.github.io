Aleatoric uncertainty estimation is a critical step in medical image segmentation. Most techniques for estimating aleatoric uncertainty for segmentation purposes assume a Gaussian distribution over the neural networkâ€™s logit value modeling the uncertainty in the predicted class. However, in many cases, such as image segmentation, there is no uncertainty about the presence of a specific structure, but rather about the precise outline of that structure. For this reason, we explicitly model the location uncertainty by redefining the conventional per-pixel segmentation task as a contour regression problem. This allows for modeling the uncertainty of contour points using a more appropriate multivariate distribution. Additionally, as contour uncertainty may be asymmetric, we use a multivariate skewed Gaussian distribution. In addition to being directly interpretable, our uncertainty estimation method outperforms previous methods on three datasets using two different image modalities. Code is available [here](https://github.com/ThierryJudge/contouring-uncertainty).
