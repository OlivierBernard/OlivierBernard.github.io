excerpt: 'Color Doppler echocardiography is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality that provides real-time information about the intracardiac blood flow. In an apical long-axis view of the left ventricle, color Doppler is subject to phase wrapping, or aliasing, especially during cardiac filling and ejection. When setting up quantitative methods based on color Doppler, it is necessary to correct this wrapping artifact. We developed an unfolded primal-dual network to unwrap (dealias) color Doppler echocardiographic images and compared its effectiveness against two state-of-the-art segmentation approaches based on nnU-Net and transformer models.'
