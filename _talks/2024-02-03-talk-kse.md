AI paradigm now enables automatic and robust extraction of cardiac function descriptors from echocardiographic sequences, such as ejection fraction or strain. These descriptors provide fine-grained information that physicians consider, in conjunction with more global variables from the clinical record, to assess patients' condition. In this presentation, I introduced a recently developed transformer-based framework that takes into account all descriptors extracted from medical records and echocardiograms. The framework aims to learn the representation of a challenging cardiovascular pathology, specifically hypertension. I showed that for descriptors whose interactions with hypertension are well documented, patterns are consistent with prior physiological knowledge, paving the way for further clinical studies to better understand this disease.
