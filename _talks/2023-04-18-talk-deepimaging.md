In this presentation, I taught the formalism of the variational auto-encoder and emphasized the importance of creating specialized latent spaces using various examples. I then described the auto-encoder formalism and highlighted the additional advantages of the variational approach. I concluded by showing how we have exploited this formalism in order to 1) provide guarantees on the segmented anatomical structures; ii) provide guarantees on the temporal consistency of the segmented shapes; iii) model the uncertainty of the segmentation algorithm.
