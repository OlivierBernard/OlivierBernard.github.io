In this presentation, I taught the formalism of the variational auto-encoder and emphasized the importance of creating specialized latent spaces using various examples. I then described the auto-encoder formalism and highlighted the additional advantages of the variational approach. I concluded by illustrating how VAE can improve the temporal consistency of segmentation results in echocardiography.
