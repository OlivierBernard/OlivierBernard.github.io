In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have shown remarkable success in the field of medical imaging. While supervised learning approaches currently stand as the most effective methods, they rely heavily on ground truth data usually obtained from manual annotations, which often poses challenges across diverse applications. In this presentation, I introduced a comprehensive pipeline aimed at generating realistic simulations of echocardiographic image sequences to be used as inputs for supervised learning algorithms. I showcased their application in two different areas: tissue motion estimation in traditional imaging and ultra-fast cardiac image reconstruction.
