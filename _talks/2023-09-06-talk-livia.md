In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have shown remarkable success in the field of medical imaging. While supervised learning approaches currently stand as the most effective methods, they rely heavily on ground truth data usually obtained from manual annotations, which often poses challenges across diverse applications. In this presentation, I introduced a comprehensive pipeline aimed at generating realistic simulations of echocardiographic image sequences to be used as inputs for supervised learning algorithms. I showcased their application in two different areas: tissue motion estimation in traditional imaging and ultra-fast cardiac image reconstruction.

For several years now, deep learning techniques have been successfully applied to medical imaging in general, and echocardiography in particular. Far from being the promised panacea, these methods have allowed major advances in many specific areas such as echocardiogram analysis, view classification, recognition and segmentation of anatomical structures, user guidance or even automatic report generation. Moreover, the combination of these different techniques allows the deployment of complete and fully automated processing chains, making it possible to increase the reliability of clinical measurements and facilitate the use of ultrasound scanners outside of hospitals. In this talk, I described proven deep learning techniques, why they have led to significant improvements in many cardio-vascular applications, their limitations, and the innovations needed to keep the echocardiographic imaging revolution moving forward.
