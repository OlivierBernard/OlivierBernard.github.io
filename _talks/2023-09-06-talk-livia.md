Deep learning methods have allowed major advances in many specific areas such as echocardiogram analysis, view classification, recognition and segmentation of anatomical structures, user guidance or even automatic report generation. Moreover, the combination of these different techniques allows the deployment of complete and fully automated processing chains, making it possible to increase the reliability of clinical measurements and facilitate the use of ultrasound scanners outside of hospitals. In this talk, I described the various advances we have made using the deep learning paradigm for echocardigraphy image segmentation.
