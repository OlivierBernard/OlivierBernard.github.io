Variational auto-encoder (VAE) techniques have proven to be powerful techniques for an efficient representation of problems in reduced dimensional spaces, allowing relevant processing / analysis. During this talk, I illustrated the power of VAE through the application of echocardiographic image segmentation. In particular, I showed how we have exploited this formalism in order to 1) provide guarantees on the segmented anatomical structures; ii) provide guarantees on the temporal consistency of the segmented shapes; iii) model the uncertainty of the segmentation algorithm.
