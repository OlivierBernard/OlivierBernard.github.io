For several years now, deep learning (DL) techniques have been successfully applied to the segmentation of medical imaging. Several pilot studies initially showed the superiority of DL over conventional methods using databases of around one hundred patients. However, these initial results have raised other issues. Firstly, the generalization of DL methods to larger databases with high variability in shapes, vendors, image quality, and pathologies poses a challenge. Secondly, there is difficulty in producing reliable expert annotations on large databases. These challenges cast doubt on the ability of DL methods to provide a definitive solution to the segmentation problem in medical imaging. However, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) research have revolutionized computer vision and image processing. This has led to the development of new powerful and more generic tools such as foundation models and reinforcement learning methods. Will the application of these tools in our field lead to the definitive resolution of segmentation in medical imaging in the near future? This is the burning question that I will address in my presentation.
