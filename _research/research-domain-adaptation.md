This work is currently under investigation by <strong>Arnaud Judge</strong>, a master student co-supervised with Pr. <strong>Pierre-Marc Jodoin</strong> at the university of Sherbrooke and expert in AI.

We have developed an nnU-Net architecture that produces highly accurate segmentation scores within intra-observer variability. These results have been validated using a CAMUS data set comprising echocardiographic images from 500 patients. This pilot study demonstrated the effectiveness of the CNN method in solving the problem of segmentation in echocardiographic imaging. However, the problem of generalization remains entirely open. This corresponds to the ability of our method to produce the same quality of results, but on much larger databases with greater heterogeneity in terms of manufacturers, image quality and type of pathology.
