title: "Representation learning for gold standard segmentation generation"
excerpt: "We have developed a strategy based on learning the representation of plausible cardiac shapes to efficiently generate gold standard annotations. This pipeline has been successfully applied to two other tasks: the simulation of realistic echocardiographic sequences and the generalization of segmentation tools.
